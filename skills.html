            <p>I have been working with these three languages for over a decade now and they tend to be my favorite three!  Learning
                how to create beautiful templates, figuring out dynamic methods, and making optimized sites are some of my favorite things to do.  
                I truly love learning about how the web works, so spending years learning to become a developer was on the top of my list. The creation of content, 
                styling and placement, and functionality all come together and create eye popping websites.

            <p>Creating applications in these three languages as well as figuring out the concepts proved to be a hefty challenge at CSU Global.
                I have learned how to create interfaces, work with multithreading, work with loops, algorithms, functions, classes, etc.  
                Security vulnerabilities was also a very important subject touched in many of my classes and preventing these was always top priority.
