            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <img src="img/runescape.png" alt="Picture of Old School Runescape">
            <p>I became a bit of a video game enthusiast all the way back at age 3.  Both of my parents and all of my siblings are gamers.  
                I played professionally for a few years, used to stream and make gaming related videos, and now just play casually.  
                One of my favorite games (pictured above), Old School Runescape is where I began a lot of my online gaming journey.

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <img src="img/mountains.jpg" alt="View of Lake Dillon in Colorado">
            <p>Hiking is definitely my favorite outdoor activity.  I love to hike in the snow, in the rain, or just in plain sunny weather.  
                My favorite part is climbing tall mountains and taking beautiful pictures of the scenery.  I also love to just enjoy the peacefulness that comes
                along with being outdoors.  The image above is of one my hikes up in the Colorado Mountains!

            <h2>Learning Languages</h2>
            <p>One of my odd hobbies is learning new languages for fun.  While this is a hard tasks, it is very rewarding for me to accomplish This.
                The two languages that I have practiced the most have been Japanese and Spanish.  One of my favorite parts about learning these languages
                are that they have enabled me to understand cultures that I would have normally been oblivious to.
