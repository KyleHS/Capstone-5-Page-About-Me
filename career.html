            <p>Web development was always my number one interest and led me to pursuing Computer Science.
                I have learned to build websites from scratch years ago, and still continue to learn new things as the years go by!
                My biggest hope is to start as a front end web developer with hopes in eventually pathing into back end or full stack development.
                I have worked heaps in both front and back end so far and really have a passion for this field!

            <p>I feel cyber security is one part of Computer Science that gives me purpose.  Being able to strengthen applications and websites
                from cyber attacks is a way of protecting people from malicious behavior.  This purpose makes cyber security number two
                on my career list.  I have become knowledgeable on many cybersecurity topics, and know how to make applicaitons more versatile
                in a world where these attacks are becoming smarter.
